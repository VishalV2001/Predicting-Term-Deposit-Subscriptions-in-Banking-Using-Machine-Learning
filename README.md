# Predicting Term Deposit Subscriptions in Banking Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project employs machine learning techniques to predict term deposit subscriptions in banking data. By analyzing demographics, financial history, and marketing interactions, it aims to accurately identify potential subscribers. Through meticulous data analysis, pre-processing, feature engineering, and model selection, the project optimizes Random Forest and XGBoost models.

## Key Objectives
- **Data Analysis**: Examine and understand the data, including demographics, financial history, and marketing interactions.
- **Pre-processing**: Clean and prepare the data for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features to enhance model performance.
- **Model Selection**: Evaluate and select the best-performing models for prediction.

## Models Used
- **Random Forest**: A robust ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and control over-fitting.
- **XGBoost**: An optimized gradient boosting algorithm that shows superior performance with an accuracy of 91.31%.

## Results
XGBoost outperforms Random Forest, achieving an impressive accuracy of 91.31%. The insights derived from this model can help banks in targeted marketing and resource allocation, leading to improved subscription rates and enhanced customer satisfaction.
